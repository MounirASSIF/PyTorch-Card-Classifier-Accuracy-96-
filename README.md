# Card Classification Project

This project implements an image classification model to detect playing cards using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of playing card images and can classify them into different categories.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of playing cards and place the images in the appropriate directories under `data/`.
 
2. Use the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/card_classification.ipynb` to run the entire workflow, including data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
 
3. Modify the parameters in the notebook as needed to suit your specific requirements.
 
4. Alternatively, run the notebook directly online:
